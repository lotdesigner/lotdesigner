- Sketch your lot before submitting a **minor variance application** or **consent to sever**
- Draw a site plan for a **building permit** (deck, garage, shed, addition)
- Figure out setbacks before you start digging
- Visualize a fence line, driveway, or landscaping project
- Understand your property before buying

...then this is for you. Open it in your browser, draw your lot, and export a clean PDF — in minutes, for free.

## Common Uses for Homeowners

### 🏗️ Building Permit Applications
Most municipalities require a simple site plan showing your lot, existing structures, and the proposed new structure with dimensions and setbacks. This tool is perfect for producing that sketch for **decks, garages, sheds, carports, pools, and additions**.

### 📋 Minor Variance Applications
Applying to your local Committee of Adjustment for relief from a zoning bylaw (e.g. reduced setback, increased lot coverage)? You'll typically need a sketch showing existing and proposed conditions. Draw it here, export to PDF, attach to your application.

### ✂️ Consent to Sever / Lot Division
Visualize how a lot split would look, calculate the resulting parcel areas, and produce a rough sketch to accompany a consent application.

### 🌿 Landscaping & Backyard Planning
Plan a fence, deck, garden, or driveway before buying materials. Know your measurements before you call a contractor.

### 🏡 Understanding Your Property
Take your survey dimensions and trace them out to finally understand what your lot actually looks like at scale.
